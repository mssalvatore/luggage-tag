# luggage-tag

A repo for 3D printing luggage tags

The STL files in this repo are from
https://www.printables.com/model/945778-luggage-tag. They are scaled down to
suit my needs. Use the tags.odt to create the tags that will fit into the
printed frame.


This produces fully printed tags.

The ODG file, sewable-tags.odg, produces tags suitable for sewing onto 1"
webbing.
